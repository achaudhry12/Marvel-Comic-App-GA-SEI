# Project Overview


## Project Name

Avengers Assemble - Marvel Comics Superhero Database


## Project Description

Avengers Assemble is a React build that uses an API from Marvel Comics and an Airtable to allow for the sorting of characters. The user is able to navigate from a homepage to the database, to a seperate page where they can create their own Avengers team, and a section where they can create their own superhero and add it to the team. The user will be able to search through a database of superheros in which they can access more information about the superhero (i.e. thier superpowers, origin, short description and the comics they are in). The user will be allowed to select from the database to create thier own team in an interactive menu. The user will be able to complete a form and make their own custom superhero. The user will be allowed to delete any created superheros and delete any created teams.
